Trained model using Decision Tree and Random Forest algorithms both for predicting the authenticity of a provided bank note. Both had similar accuracy. We can go with Decision Trees algorithm if required a simpler model with easy explainability. We can go with Random Forest if accuracy is more important that the details of how we received the outcomes.
